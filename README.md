## About PreppinData

[Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) is a blog and community-driven platform that offers weekly data preparation challenges. These challenges are designed to enhance your data manipulation and analysis skills using Tableau Prep, although these challenges can be solved using tools such as Excel, Alteryx, SQL, and Python. Each week, a new challenge is released, presenting a unique dataset and a set of requirements to accomplish.

## Weekly Challenge Solutions

In this repository, I will share my solutions to the PreppinData weekly challenges for the year 2023. Each challenge will have its own dedicated folder, containing the following components:

+ Solution Files: The solution files will be provided in form of a Python Jupyter Notebook. These files will contain the code and steps to transform the given dataset and meet the specified requirements.

+ Input Datasets: The input datasets used in each challenge will be provided in the `data/input` directory.

+ Output Datasets: The output datasets generated after applying the transformations will be included in the `data/output` directory. These datasets will help you verify the correctness of the solution and compare your results with mine.

## Contributing
